  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings, parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation, but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani, basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
    <li>2 large onions, finely chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>Â½ teaspoon chili powder</li>
    <li>1 (2 inch) piece cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
    <li>1kg grams boneless, skinless chicken pieces cut into chunks</li>
    <li>400 grams basmati rice</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
      <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li>
      <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
      <li>Add chicken mixture and boiled rice; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil.</li>
      <li>Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid, and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring.</li>
      <li>Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.</li>
    </ol>
